# Mode-Separation-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

This was a research project developed using Pytorch framework that solves mode-separation problem in generative adversarial networks.
Mode-separation problem is very common in Gans where the netowrk cannot learn efficiently if there is lot of different distribution nodes 
in the given dataset.
Using multiple CNNs and a pre-trained network we forced each NN to learn a different distribution, generating sophisticated output quality.
